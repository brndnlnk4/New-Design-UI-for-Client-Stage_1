# New-Design-UI-for-Client-Stage_1
Just started designing the frontend UI via jQUERY HTML CSS Photoshop and maybe some Flash, not sure yet. However, after design process complete then will begin writing script for backend via PHP JS AJAX mySQL

I'm currently trying to brainstorm more ideas of adding more interaction via CSS animation techniques
